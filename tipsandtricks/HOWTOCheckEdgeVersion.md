### Description
Edge was initially built with Microsoft's own proprietary browser engine EdgeHTML. Microsoft rebuild browser 
based on Chromium open source project to create better web compatibility for users and less fragmentation for developers.
So, the original version of Edge is now officially called the “Legacy” version of Edge. 
You can still download the new Edge `chromium-based` from [`Microsoft’s website`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) 
After installation, it will replace the old Edge browser with the new version. Also, it will be automatically upgraded to 
latest version.
To ensure PCs don’t automatically download and install the new Edge, Microsoft offers a 
[Chromium Edge update blocker toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-blocker-toolkit)
