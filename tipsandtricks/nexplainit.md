## What is this?
17 months ago - to the exact day - March 30th, 2018 saw the [first release](https://github.com/nexiality/nexial-core/releases/tag/nexial-core-1.0)
of [Nexial Automation to GitHub](https://github.com/nexiality/nexial-core). Since then, through a fairly consistent
monthly release cadence, we have added a wide array of capabilities to Nexial - and we will continue to do so. The 
culmination of these capabilities opens up greater possibilities and opportunities to test, to automate and ultimately 
to elevate Product Quality. The [Commands](http://nexiality.github.io/documentation/commands) page gives one a sense of 
what can be accomplished through Nexial. In addition, we continually enhancing Nexial's 
[built-in functions](https://nexiality.github.io/documentation/functions/),
[Nexial Expression](https://nexiality.github.io/documentation/expressions/), 
[JsonPath](https://nexiality.github.io/documentation/jsonpath/), 
[Nexial Interactive](https://nexiality.github.io/documentation/interactive/), etc. While Nexial cannot solve all the
testing and automation hurdles (_no, it doesn't make breakfast, yet_), we are committed, in one or more ways, to better
equip you as a Quality Engineer.

Following this same spirit of continuous improvement, we recognize the need to drastically improve the existing
Nexial documentation in terms of details and clarity.  In addition, we need more content for learning and for 
understanding Nexial. Better content will certainly benefit the existing Nexial community as well as boost adoptions. 
And this is where _you_ come in...

<div style="color: #fff !important; background-color: rgba(90, 115, 75, 0.9); padding: 20px; font-size: 16pt;">
Help us create <u><i>awesome</i></u> Nexial tutorials - and, yes this is a contest 
<span style="font-family: monospace; color:#ccc; font-size: 12pt;">(translation: prizes)</span>!<br/>
</div>

This contest is to come up with the best online tutorial - either a screencast, a video or an online step-by-step 
guide - that demonstrates Nexial Automation and explains how a Nexial feature or a combination of features works. 
In keeping up with the culture of "QA Helping QA" and Continuous Learning, this is an **invitation** for all of us to 
participate. Fly solo or work as a small team, this is your opportunity to enlighten your fellow QE's with your 
knowledge on Nexial, your wit about test automation, or even better, your insight on amplifying Product Quality using
Nexial. 

Your tutorial can be anything regarding Nexial. Perhaps an introductory screencast on how to run Web Automation on 
Nexial, or how [Nexial Interactive](../interactive) can speed up automation scripting. How about automating multiple 
API endpoints using dynamically generated data set? Or the setup and tear-down automation of seeding dataset to 
multiple databases? Another thought-provoking idea is to use Nexial to collect data for post-execution analysis. 
Maybe a tutorial on automation regarding image or Excel or PDF? Maybe a series on JSON manipulation using 
[JsonPath](../jsonpath)? Or perhaps you can create a screencast to demonstrate how you overcome a tricky automation 
hurdle... The possibilities are endless!

When we all participate together, all of us benefit from it. Sharing these tutorials within the Nexial community
strengthens the community from within. And, _did I mention there're prizes_...?
