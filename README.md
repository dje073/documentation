> _**nexial**_  - joining together.  It refers to the joining of knowledge from multiple perspectives 
and practices to achieve a new understanding of ourselves and nature, and to fuel cultural 
advancement. 

The name reflects our desire and intention to perfect the "art" and "science" of Software Testing 
and the promotion of Quality Artisan.  As professional QA, we are all _nexialists_ - we see links
in the disconnected and synergy in the seemingly independent, and draw from such new 
ideas/solutions.

## Introduction

The main motivation of Nexial is to provide a set of capabilities to automate software testing.  
Here's some of the core concerns of this platform:

- ***Test automation for everyone*** - no coding experience required (but supported), simple and 
  valuable to all project participants
- Keyword-driven via simple/familiar spreadsheet interface
- Hybrid approach to support keyword-based tests and program/script -based tests
- Local and remote (Jenkins, BrowserStack) support
- Integration to existing collaboration tools such as JIRA and Confluence
- Supports various application architecture, includes web (browser), desktop, API/REST/SOAP, 
		database, batch, ssh
- Extensive and flexible test management
- Data management and data generation
- Supports FRIP (functional, regression, integration, performance testing)
