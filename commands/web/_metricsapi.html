      The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/" class="external-link" target="_nexial_link">
      W3C Navigation Timing API</a> provides the tools to measure the critical milestones for the main HTML document:
      DNS, TCP, request and response, and even DOM-level timing metrics. This API exposes the metrics as accurate and
      detailed timing statistics — natively — for page navigation and load events. It's available now in Internet
      Explorer 9 - 11, Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari.<br/>
      <br/>
      The exact metrics exposed via this API can be found in the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming" class="external-link"
         target="_nexial_link">MDN web docs</a>. The amount of timing and events being tracked through this API can be
      overwhelming and possibly confusing. To streamline the metrics collection and to simplify analysis, Nexial
      implemented a series of <i>simpler</i> data points via System variables. The image below depicts the mapping
      between Nexial supported metrics and W3C's timing events. Click on the image below to open a larger version on a
      separate tab.<br/>

      This API that allows you to collect lifecycle timing information related to resources in a document. It enables
      one to measure user latency, which is crucial to benchmark web pages.<br/>

      Using the Resource Timing API allows us to retrieve and analyze a detailed profile of all the network timing data
      for every resource on the page. As such we can use this API to track the performance of the resources of our page,
      and determine how many and what resources we have to optimize.

      3. **Paint Timing**<br/>
      First Paint (FP) is the first of these key moments, followed by First Contentful Paint (FCP). These metrics mark
      the points, immediately after navigation, when the browser renders pixels to the screen. This is important to the
      user because it answers the question: is it happening?

      The primary difference between the two metrics is FP marks the point when the browser renders anything that is
      visually different from what was on the screen prior to navigation. By contrast, FCP is the point when the browser
      renders the first bit of content from the DOM, which may be text, an image, SVG, or even a canvas element.
