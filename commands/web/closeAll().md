### Description

- This command will close the current browser instance, effectively closing all open windows/tabs.  Note that all browser related operations will likely result in error after this command is executed â€“ except for [open(url)](https://confluence.ep.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9985751) or [openAndWait(url,waitMs)](https://confluence.ep.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9985753), which will in turn create new browser instance as a result.
- Closing a browser instance **DOES NOT** necessarily terminate any running web sessions on the corresponding server application.  Some cookies are created as [persistent](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/persistent_cookie.html) and will remain as is between browser sessions.  Hence one should not reply on closing browser tab/window/instance as a guarantee to terminate or abandon web sessions.  Check [webcookie](https://confluence.ep.com/display/QA/webcookie) page for available commands regarding cookies.
